## Tetra Offline

Welcome to the Tetra Offline project. Tetra Offline is an open-source version of the game *Tetra Online*.
Tetra Offline is a singleplayer block-stacker game made in Unity. It had the goal of bringing a new competitive experience, mixing quick and slow play-styles into one. 
Tetra Online is no longer available due to DMCA issues.

## Why is it Offline?
Tetra Online used to have full online functionality with players all around the world. However, all online features had to be removed from this project to make it run without the Steam API, and refactoring the code to make the online work without Steam is possible, but I'm unwilling to do it, as the original game's code is both difficult to modify and extremely dependent on the Steam API. Even porting singleplayer was quite complicated, and took quite a few hours of work for the game to compile correctly. 

## Will Tetra Online come back?
No. Tetra Online will not come back officially. Tetra Developer Studios considers Tetra Online legacy software which will not be updated. We are working on a new game though, please, have patience.
